SubtleAttentionSeekerDemo
=========================

[cyrilmottier][0]'s "subtle attention seeker" Android view animation ported to NineOldAndroids extending the compatibility down to API 8.

Based on Cyril's examples from [Google+ post][1].

Porting to pre-API11 made possible by wonderful [NineOldAndroids][2] (and [ActionBarSherlock][3]) from [JakeWharton][4].

Remember: use it, but don't abuse it :)
